This is a custom hacked up version of pprof from google-perftools.
I have extended it to interoperate with XDEBUG so that we can get
managed symbols in our profiles.

Usage:

1. Generate your profile while running with MONO_XDEBUG=1 enabled
2. moonprof -xdb=/path/to/xdb.s /usr/lib/firefox/firefox /path/to/your.profile
