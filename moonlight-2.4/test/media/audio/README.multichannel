 Preparing input files
=======================================

(on linux):
- Download the 5.1 audio files from www.bigbuckbunny.org:
  http://media.xiph.org/BBB/BigBuckBunny-DVDMaster-5_1-FLAC.zip
- Unzip that file
- Create trimmed wav files using trim.sh (included) (the 9-16
  indicates that the file is cut from 00:09.000 to 00:16.000 -
  no need to have a 10 minute audio file, those 7 seconds aren't
  silence and is plenty enough to test what we want to test)
- You now have all the required 5.1 audio files in the current directory.

wget http://media.xiph.org/BBB/BigBuckBunny-DVDMaster-5_1-FLAC.zip
unzip BigBuckBunny-DVDMaster-5_1-FLAC.zip
./trim.sh

(on windows)
- download WavAviMux:
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=72F6F2FA-0ABE-4A92-9DD0-FD35B966825C&displaylang=en
  (this requires genuine windows validation)
- Execute create-7.1-avi.cmd, this will create a 7.1 avi file from the
  5.1 wav files previously created (this is required since windows media
  encoder can't use 8 separate audio files for 7.1 encoding, it needs
  either a single avi or wav file with all the channels). The back left/right
  channels are duplicated in the side left/right channels to get 7.1 audio
  from 6 files.

=======================================
 Encoding
=======================================

Install Windows Media Encoder:

(requires genuine windows validation)

Determine if you can encode WMAPRO9 or WMAPRO10:
- Open Windows Media Encoder
- If you get a "New Session" dialog, cancel it
- Click "Properties" on the toolbar -> Compression -> Edit and in the
  Audio/Codec combobox you'll see either: "Windows Media Audio 9 Professional"
  or "Windows Media Audio 10 Professional" (you'll have to open the comobox,
  these codecs aren't the default ones).

Open each of the WMAPRO9/10 wme files (you probably need to fix up paths,
full paths are stored in the wme file) and click on 'Start Encoding'.

The default for Windows XP is to have the WMAPRO9 codec (with Windows Media
Player 9), the WMAPRO10 codec comes with Windows Media Player 11 (an optional
upgrade). This means that you can't generate both WMAPRO9 and WMAPRO10 content
on the same computer unless you uninstall/reinstall/upgrade Windows Media
Player for each codec.
