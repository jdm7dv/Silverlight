Test cases for EnableHTMLAccess

The unit tests (i.e. moon-unit) requires EnableHTMLAccess to be true
(i.e. well to have access to the HTML DOM) in order to work. So we're
testing the non-availability (versus the ability) here.

1. Same-domain test

a) "make"

b) start a web server (e.g. xsp)

c) open firefox on the following files:

   * enableHtmlAccess.html

	First line should be: "EnabledHTMLAccess == true"
	That's the default for single-domain applications
	All other lines, until END, should start with "OK:"

   * enableHtmlAccess-false.html

	First line should be: "EnabledHTMLAccess == false"
	That's the default for single-domain applications
	All other lines, until END, should start with "OK:"

   * enableHtmlAccess-true.html

	Just like enableHtmlAccess.html (default)


2. Cross-domain test
