	* SilverlightTestService.cs: Don't use the isolated storage
	settings.  This causes crashes in one of the MS tests.

	* SilverlightTestService.cs: Revert r120118, it's no longer needed (we
	  don't hit this code at all).

	* SilverlightTestService.cs: Attempting to use the web service on localhost
	when we might be running against a remote site raises a security exception
	on MSFT's runtime, causing the harness to fail.  Lets just use the direct
	connection method which appears to work everywhere.
