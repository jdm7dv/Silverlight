	* VisualStudioLogProvider.Writer.cs: We can get null strings here
	when there is a known failure that doesn't have a description.

2009-03-25  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* TestMethodManager.cs: There might be more than one
	  BugAttribute on a method, handle this properly.

2009-03-04  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* TestMethodManager.cs: If there is an async moon-unit test,
	  all the async tasks are executed even if an exception is
	  thrown in the first one. This means that if assertion 1
	  fails and then assertion 2 fails, the information from
	  assertion 1 is lost.

2009-01-14  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* TestMethodManager.cs: Add a Platforms field to BugAttribute so that we
	can specify which platform the test fails on. MoonlightBugAttribute
	sets this to Unix, and SilverlightBugAttribute to Mac and Windows.

2009-01-08  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* TestMethodManager.cs: Only display the bug text if the bug is of the
	right type for the platform the test is running on.

2008-12-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* TestMethodManager.cs: Add support for MoonlightBug and
	  SilverlightBug, and only report them as failed bugs if platform
	  actually matches the bug.

2008-12-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* TestMethodManager.cs, TestClassManager.cs,
	  UnitTestLogMessageWriter.cs: Provide class or method in the log
	  message for ignored tests.

2008-11-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* VisualStudioLogProvider.Writer.cs, VisualStudioLogProvider.cs: Remove
	  the VISUALSTUDIO_SUPPORT ifdef, not needed anymore.

2008-11-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* VisualStudioLogProvider.Writer.cs, VisualStudioLogProvider.cs: ifdef
	  out all code to access VisualStudio. Add MD project and solutions.
