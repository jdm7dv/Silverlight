	* ConditionalWorkItem.cs: Double conditional wait timeout,
	  should make the slow x86 bots happier.

2009-03-04  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* CompositeWorkItem.cs: In the case that an async test throws
	an exception, ensure we continue running the harness.

2009-03-04  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* ConditionalWorkItem.cs: Add the ability to append a failure
	  message to EnqueueConditional to make it easy to tell which
	  EnqueueConditional fails when a test uses this multiple
	  times.

2009-02-18  Alan McGovern <amcgovern@novell.com> 
	* ConditionalWorkItem.cs: Add a timeout value so that waiting
	on a conditional will never block indefinitely.
