SETUP

* Make sure your /etc/hosts files contains entries for policy-client,
flash-[1..99] and silverlight-[1-99] that maps to your server IP address

	192.168.0.1	policy-client.moonlight.test
	192.168.0.1	flash-1.moonlight.test
	...
	192.168.0.1	flash-99.moonlight.test
	192.168.0.1	silverlight-1.moonlight.test
	...
	192.168.0.1	silverlight-99.moonlight.test


HOWTO

* Start your web server on port 80, e.g.

	sudo xsp2 --port 80

* Start the web browser on http://policy-client.moonlight.test/WebPolicies.html

* Click on "WebClient" and check results (should all PASS)

* Refresh or re-start web browser (since policies are cached!)

* Click on "WebRequest" and check results (should all PASS)


WRITING NEW TESTS

* Each new policy must use a new host name. Bump the above (setup) limit
if required.

* By convention Flash policies use host named flash-# while Silverlight 
policies use silverlight-#. Try to stick with them unless your testing
host naming.

* Page.xaml.cs must be given one (or many) new entry(ies) to test the new
policy.
	* Specify the URL to be tested.
	* Speficy the excepted response (OK or SecurityException). If
	required add your own response logic.

* Global.asax must return the required policy based on the server name.
Since this is ASP.NET there's no need to restart the web server after 
each change.

* Make sure your new test case works on Silverlight then try it on
Moonlight.


NOTES

* The SL application MUST be executed from another host (i.e. not 
flash-* or silverlight-*) since this is testing cross-domain policies.
This is why "policy-client" exists. Using this name also allows you to 
share the web server running Global.asax

* The server (Global.asax) side can be edited without re-starting XSP.

* The client side must be refreshed or restarted since policies are 
cached by the runtime.
