Howto:

* Create a test which takes a screenshot and has no managed code:
- Copy and edit test-screenshot-template.html.

* Create a managed test which takes a screenshot:
- Copy and edit the template/managed directory.

* Include the test in the harness:
- Add a new test definition in silverlight2/Moonlight/drtlist.xml.

* Create masters on Windows:
- Start xsp2 in moon/test (on linux)
- Checkout silverlight2/Moonlight/GenerateMasters (on Windows)
- Execute Baseliner.exe, enter "http://<linux ip>:8080/templates/test-screenshot-template.html" and hit the button
- After a few seconds a explorer window should open with the screenshot(s) taken.

* Issues:
- IE caches heavily and doesn't seem to work well with xsp, so you may need to clear IE's cache to get updated files.
