* If the test is uses silverlight animation, please indicate so by using 'animation' in the file name.


NON-WORKING



* test-path-group-2.xaml

	The XAML parser replace the first GeometryGroup with the second
	instead of merging both. Bug #325279

* test-path-group-stoke.xaml

	Degenerate cases works like individual shapes being rendered (i.e.
	no FillRule is applied) and some geometries can be non-degenerated.
	Note: also suffers from #325279

* test-inkpresenter.xaml
* test-inkpresenter-drawingattributes.xaml
* test-inkpresenter-height-width.xaml

	Work in progress
