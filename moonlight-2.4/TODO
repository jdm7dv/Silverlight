Feel free to add items to this TODO list

* SupportedCulture:

	This requires special handling on the XAML processor.
	
	There are no visible properties from SupportedCulture, instead the
	XAML processor should read the content as in:
	
	   <SupportedCulture>cultureName</SupportedCulture> 
	
	And use that to instantiate the supported cultures somewhere, not
	clear where.

* SPECS:

	Need information on the relative Uris that
	Application.GetResourceStream accepts and their meaning.

Silverlight 2 Support
=====================

	To get Silverlight 2 support to work, we need a few bits:

	Application.LoadComponent:

		This requires changes to the XAML parser to allow the
		XAML parser to use an object that has been already
		created as its toplevel, and populate it with data
		from parsing a XAML file.

	Surface::Attach:

	      Currently it only allows the passed object to be a
	      Canvas, with SL2 the passed object can be a UserControl.

	      Maybe we could wrap the object in a Canvas to keep
	      things simple?

Cleanup
========

	We are currently using `PluginHost.Handle' to track the handle
	to the plugin, and in a couple of places we also use the
	AppDomain to pass information, its not clear why this code was
	added:

	    AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetData ("PluginInstance");


        In plugin/moonlight.cs, separate the appdomain management from
        the Loader class.

	Move plugin/moonlight.cs CreateApplication into its own helper
	class.

* Consolidation

	Now that Mono.Moonlight.dll has been rolled into
	System.Windows.dll, and the AppDomain hacks have been removed
	from moonlight.exe, we should be able to further reduce our
	managed footprint and per-domain costs by removing
	moonlight.exe altogether.

* AppDomains

	Most of the AppDomain infrastructure (MarshalByRef,
	Serialization, Remoting) is unavailable in SL 2.0, currently
	we keep it all hidden with our linker, but it might be worth
	exploring dropping this infrastructure if not required.

	Need to pass the object initialization arguments to the
	Application.Startup method, currently we pass an emty list, it
	should be the list of arguments from the <object> tag.

* xaml.cpp:

	How to register SupportedCultureCollection, as there is no
	"SupportedCulture" really.
