The files in this directory come from the MiniZip unzip101e.zip
distribution, the original distribution can be found here:

	http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html

	"The Zlib library allows to deflate compressed files and to
	create gzip (.gz) files. Zlib is free software and small.

	An archive in ZIP format can contain several files compressed
	with this method, while a .gz archive can containt only one
	file. It is a very popular format, that is why I have written
	a package for reading files compressed within a Zip archive."

There is no README included with the original minizip library.

This is a subset of the minizip library, we only use the unzip
capability and do not ship the actual command line tools (zip, unzip).
