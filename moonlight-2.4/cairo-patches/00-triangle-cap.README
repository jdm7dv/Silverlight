This patch adds a triangle line cap (CAIRO_LINE_CAP_TRIANGLE) to Cairo 1.6.

Unlike SVG Silverlight supports triangle line cap. Without this patch 
Moonlight "approximates" it as a round line cap.

This is unlikely to be accepted upstream as it doesn't provide support for 
PDF, PS and SVG backends (none of them required for Moonlight). The right
solution (for cairo) would be to provide a callback API for user-drawn
line caps (so it would work for all backends).
