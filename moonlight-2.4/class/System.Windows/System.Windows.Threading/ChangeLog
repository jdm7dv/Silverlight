	r: rolf

2009-09-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: Removed unused member variable.

	r:spouliot

2009-09-18  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: Updated for DispatcherOperation API change.

	* DispatcherOperation.cs (ToString): Renamed to not clash with
	object.ToString().

	r:kangaroo

2009-08-25  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: This chunk is a little crashy when called from
	the finalizer, ifdef it for now.  r: shana.

2009-08-06  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs (Dispose): time_manager_remove_tick_call takes
	another arg now.

2009-05-13  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* DispatcherOperation.cs (Invoke): Return InnerException if the
	exception thrown is a TargetInvocationException (see DRT #357)

2009-04-14  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: Fix add_tick_call pinvoke (no return val),
	use flag to detect useless pinvoke calls instead.

2009-03-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: track move of TickCallHandler from
	Mono.NativeMethods to Mono.

2009-03-25  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: Fix default duration

2009-02-22  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: Cache the surface when the dispatcher is created
	to avoid unnecessary M->N's and possible cross-thread problems.

2009-02-05  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: Ensure no exceptions reach native code.

2009-02-03  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs, DispatcherOperation.cs: Route all exceptions
	from delegate invocation to the global exception handler

2009-01-26  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: Surface lives in Deployment now.

2009-01-23  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: Add destructor to remove callback handler. 
	Dispose() output a list of calls that haven't been processed when
	the dispatcher was destroyed (they are thrown away, for now). Only
	add the callback on the native side when a call is actually made

	* DispatcherOperation.cs: Add ToString()

2009-01-13  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* DispatcherSynchronizationContext.cs: Implemented

	* Dispatcher.cs: Add static Dispatcher getter so the sync context
	class can initialize itself with the main thread dispatcher in the
	default	constructor

2009-01-13  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: Remove unused event object

2009-01-12  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: reenable new DispatcherTimer implementation

2009-01-09  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: Keep a GCHandle to the DispatcherTimer in case the
	client code doesn't keep a reference to it to prevent a GC (from rolf).
	Change the callback into a static member and use the GCHandle to derive
	the target.  Fixes a crash where the callback is nulled in Stop when called
	from the Tick and GC'd.  Check that our source_id hasn't changed in the Tick
	to ensure that we havn't been Stop()'d and Start()'d so that we properly 
	remove ourselves from the glib loop as well as the time manager.

2009-01-06  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: Add params to Dispatcher.BeginInvoke signature.

2008-12-29  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: Revert changes so that unit tests can run, while
	I fix the callbacks

2008-12-22  Andreia Gaita  <avidigal@novell.com>

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: Implement DispatcherTimer using an internal
	class (Mono.DispatcherTimer).

2008-12-11  Andreia Gaita <shana@jitted.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs, DispatcherOperation.cs: Implement Dispatcher. It now
	  registers delegates to one list of DispatcherOperations and adds a
	  single tick call for a callback that handles all the operations on the
	  list. DispatcherOperation is just a wrapper for a delegate and
	  it's arguments. Dispatcher also includes a synchronous Invoke method
	  for internal use, so our code can also use the Dispatcher when it needs
	  to do synchronous calls to the ui thread from ui or non-ui threads without
	  worrying whether it's on the right thread or not.

2008-12-03  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: timer_callback: Catch all exceptions. Prevents
	  mono from crashing due to exceptions crossing managed-native
	  boundary.

2008-08-14  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs, DispatcherTimer.cs: Use the time manager
	to register our idle calls and timeouts.

2008-08-14  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs, DispatcherOperation.cs: g_idle_add based
	initial implementation supporting simple dispatcher operations
	posted to the main thread.

2008-08-13  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: g_timout_add based implementation of 
	DispatcherTimer.

2008-08-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* DispatcherSynchronizationContext.cs: Stubbed missing members.

2008-08-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Dispatcher.cs, DispatcherSynchronizationContext.cs: Changed some
	  parameter names, base types, method signatures, etc to match SL.

2008-07-28  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* Dispatcher.cs: new stubs.

	* DispatcherTimer.cs: same.

	* DispatcherSynchronizationContext.cs: same.

	* DispatcherOperation.cs: same.
