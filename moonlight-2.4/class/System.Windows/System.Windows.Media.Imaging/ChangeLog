	* BitmapImage.cs: Create an empty URI if 'uriSource' is null.

	r: rolf

2009-09-23  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* DownloadProgressEventArgs.cs: there's no reason to maintain a
	reference to the native peer in this class.  The fields are all
	read-only and can be initialized in the ctor.

	* BitmapImage.cs: remove autogenerated events.

	r: spouliot, andriea

	* BitmapImage.cs: Updated according to API changes in RoutedEventArgs.

	r: andreia

2009-08-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WriteableBitmap.cs: we need to pin the pixel data in both ctors,
	so factor that out into PinAndSetBitmapData.  Also, pass false to
	bitmap_source_set_bitmap_data, so unmanaged won't free our buffer.
	it's freed in our finalizer.  fixes the double free on shutdown.

	* BitmapSource.cs (SetSource): pass true for @own to
	bitmap_source_set_bitmap_data.

2009-08-12  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* WriteableBitmap.cs: track changes to the api from SL3 beta to
	RTM.

	* WriteableBitmap.cs: Land Geoffs Render changes.

2009-04-02  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* WriteableBitmap.cs: Avoid a integer overflow that could have us
	allocating some bogus amount of memory, or writing into random memory.

2009-03-31  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* WriteableBitmap.cs: Ensure that we cannot let user code write out to 
	random memory.

2009-03-30  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* BitmapImage.cs: Fix event registration to have the proper types.

2009-03-29  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* BitmapImage.cs: Dont attempt to read a resource stream unless we
	have a uri.

2008-08-24  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* BitmapImage.cs: The URI passed to a BitmapImage isn't always
	a download, it can specify a resource/content in the xap.

2008-08-23  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* BitmapImage.cs: Implement support for getting a BitmapImage from 
	a Uri instead of a stream.

2008-08-18  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* BitmapImage.cs: Keep a reference to the stream around for later use.

2008-08-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com>
