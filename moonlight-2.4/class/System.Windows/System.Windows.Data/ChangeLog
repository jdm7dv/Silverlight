	* Binding.cs:
	* RelativeSource.cs:
	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: Implement support for
	  RelativeSource based bindings.

2009-12-02  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Binding.cs:
	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: Add provisional support for the
	  SL3 Binding.ElementName API.

2009-12-10  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs (ConvertToType): pass true for
	@doToStringConversion.

2009-12-02  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: ContentPresenter copies its
	  Content to its DataContext whenever it isn't a UIElement,
	  therefore if we're databinding the Content property we need
	  to use the parent DataContext in order to get the correct
	  value.

2009-11-09  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingExpression.cs: stub UpdateSource method.

	* Binding.cs: stub UpdateSourceTrigger property.

	* BindingExpression.cs: This is a public class in 3.0 (constructor
	is not though).

2009-09-29  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: Implement indexed property paths. r: spouliot

2009-08-05  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: When a binding has been applied to
	  the DataContext property, we need to use the DataContext of
	  the parent element.

2009-07-29  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: If a two way binding is attached
	  to TextBox.Text we should not update the source while the
	  textbox has focus.

2009-06-30  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: OneTime bindings can be
	  invalidated and they do reflect the new value.

2009-06-23  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Binding.cs: Don't null check value before using it, we
	  should throw a nullref if it's null.

2009-05-20  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: DataBinding and ManagedXamlLoader
	  use exactly the same type conversion as Styles and
	  ObjectKeyFrames - so merge both of them to use
	  MoonlightTypeConverter. This also fixes several
	  typeconversion related databinding issues.

2009-05-19  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: Handle invalid values returned
	  from IValueConverters properly.

2009-05-15  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: Properly handle exceptions when
	  updating the source in a 2 way binding. Raise the
	  BindingValidationError event in the right place.

2009-05-13  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: If we have a property path like
	  "A.B.C" and the object 'B' is null, we should bail out with
	  failure.

2009-05-03  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs rename Updating/updating to
	UpdatingSource/updatingSource to better communicate what it means,
	and make a couple of properties internal instead of private (they
	weren't used anywhere else anyway.)
	(Dispose): make sure to unhook from the PropertyChanged event too
	so that we don't continue updating our target after we've been
	disposed.

	* BindingExpression.cs: remove all the commented out code.

2009-04-03  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: Fix a few type converting issues
	  with two way bindings which are now revealed by the datagrid
	  tests.

2009-04-01  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpression.cs:
	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: TextBox only updates a two way
	  binding when it loses focus, so we need to hook into the
	  LostFocus event. Add an internal
	  BindingExpressionBase.Dispose method so that we can ensure
	  we detach from this event when the binding is removed.

2009-04-01  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: If we're updating a two way
	  binding, don't invoke the setter if the old value is the
	  same as the new value.

2009-03-26  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: If we can't convert the value to
	  the correct type, bail out without throwing an exception.

2009-03-26  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: If the datasource in a two way
	  binding doesn't exist, just return immediately. Fixes
	  several datagrid issues.

2009-03-25  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: Null check value before
	  referencing it. Allows a datagrid test to complete
	  successfully.

2009-03-25  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Binding.cs: Bindings are 100% managed now, so we need some
	local managed members here to hold some of the values that
	used to live in native.

2009-03-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* Binding.cs: Bindings cannot use PropertyPaths which are
	  instantiated with DependencyProperties, they must be
	  instantiated with a string.

2009-03-24  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: 1) When updating from an
	  INotifyPropertyChanged, mark the binding as 'Updating' so
	  that it doesn't get removed when calling
	  Target.SetValueImpl.
	2) If the target property doesn't exist (invalid binding or
	  source hasn't been set), then ignore the property changed
	  notification.

2009-02-26  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: Use Helper.DefaultCulture
	rather than declaring it here.

* BindingExpressionBase.cs: When updating from a two-way binding,
ensure we properly typeconvert from source type to dest type.

2009-03-13  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* Binding.cs: Ensure we ref, if we're going to unref

2009-02-26  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs (GetValue): mark this an override.

2009-02-26  Alan McGovern  <amcgovern@novell.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: If the property path is invalid,
	  we should bail out early and just return DP.DefaultValue.

2009-02-23  Jackson Harper  <jackson@ximian.com>

	* BindingExpressionBase.cs: If the user supplied ValueConverter
	doesn't work, try using our value converter.

2009-02-20  Jeffrey Stedfast  <fejj@novell.com>

	* Binding.cs: Throw ArgumentNullException if path is null.

2009-02-08  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* System.Windows.Data/BindingExpressionBase.cs: clean this up a
	bit, use the default value converter, rename Target <-> Source to
	match SL terminology, and remove a bunch of commented out code.
