2008-05-07  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: Remove AssemblyDelaySign(true) since it's

2008-04-15  Jb Evain  <jbevain@novell.com>

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: on non 2.1 profile, use the profile
	version as an assembly version, to differenciate better
	desktop from plugin assemblies.

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: System.Silverlight is renamed
	System.Windows.Browser.
	Merged from the Moonlight 2 branch.
