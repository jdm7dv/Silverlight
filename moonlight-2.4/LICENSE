* Moonlight source code (src/, plugin/)

	Unless explicitly stated, this code is licensed under the
	terms of the GNU LGPL 2 license only (no "later versions").

	In addition to the GNU LGPL, this code is available for
	relicensing for non-LGPL use, contact Novell for details
	(mono@novell.com).

	We consider non-LGPL use instances where you use this on an
	embedded system where the end user is not able to upgrade the
	Moonlight installation or distribution that is part of your
	product (Section 6 and 7), you would have to obtain a
	commercial license from Novell (consider software burned into
	a ROM, systems where end users would not be able to upgrade,
	an embedded console, a game console that imposes limitations
	on the distribution and access to the code, a phone platform
	that prevents end users from upgrading Moonlight).
	
	This code might contain code that optionally links to LGPL and
	GPL code, in those cases, if the library is built with those
	bits the code is covered under those licenses.

* Microsoft Silverlight Controls (class/Microsoft.SilverlightControls)

	This code is taken from Microsoft's web site, and contains the
	Silverlight 2.0 Beta 1 controls ported to the Beta 2 API.
	
	The code is licensed under the terms of the Microsoft
	Public License (MS-PL).

* Microsoft Silverlight Unit Test Framework (test/2.0/Microsoft.Silverlight.Testing)

	The code is licensed under the terms of the Microsoft
	Public License (MS-PL).

* Moonlight managed source code (class/* other than
                                 Microsoft.SilverlightControls)
  and end-user tools (tools/mopen, tools/mxap, tools/svg2xml,
      	              tools/xaml2html, tools/xamlg)
