	* ff-common.h: add new header for common structs and dom includes
	for ff2/3-dom and bridge

2009-03-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge  <RKvinge@novell.com>

	* browser-http.inc: FF2/3DownloaderResponse: propagate the
	  ref/unref to the AddRef/Release implementation

2009-01-21  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* browser-http.inc: Ensure the DownloaderResponse is aware of the DownloaderRequest

2008-11-25  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* browser-http.inc: Expose the status code and status text to the
	DownloaderResponse object.

2008-08-19  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* browser-http.inc: Add a request field to DownloaderResponse, and a
	  response field to DownloaderRequest. When a request is aborted,
	  also abort the response. This fixes a crash when we aborted the
	  request before receiving a response, the response had no idea the
	  request had been aborted (since the request didn't store the
	  response after creating it, it couldn't notify the response of the
	  abort), and happily accessed deleted objects.

2008-06-27  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>

	on the nsresult send by mozilla.

	* browser-http.inc: Dont raise Started/Stopped if we've been aborted.

2008-06-10  Geoff Norotn  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* browser-http.inc: SetRequestHeader should merge instead of replace.
	Partially fixes MMS seeking.

2008-06-05  Geoff Norotn  <gnorton@novell.com>

	* browser-http.inc: SetBody takes a void instead of char to support the future
	possibility of POSTing data.

2008-05-23  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>
	
	* browser-http.inc: Re-introduce the Abort decl in FF*Browser(Request|Response)

2008-05-23  Geoff Norton  <gnorton@novell.com>
