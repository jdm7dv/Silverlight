= Moonlight Browser Plugin Todo =


* Not properly working properties

	control.settings.windowless

* Reload page and free memory stuff

	In NPP_Destroy in plugin-glue.cpp we dont free resources, its because on 
	page reload or browser back button the browser try so access the same old
	data. We must check the "save" parameter and NPSavedData stuff to get a 
	better implementation, for now it works but with more memory consume than
	expected.

* Works for other browsers

	The plugin started working in Opera in r78918 and stopped working in r79006, 
	so any revision in between should do it.
