        <br />
        Kit3D is a 3D engine written for use with Microsoft Silverlight, XAML and Javascript.&nbsp;
        The entire engine is currently written in Javascript (allowing the possibility with
        very little work to port it to SVG).&nbsp; The engine will hopefully allow anyone
        interested in 3D graphics to see how 3D graphics can be acomplished.<br />
        <br />
        In order to get started, take a look at the template.html file inside the templates
        directory, this shows the shell of the page you will need to get a Kit3D application
        working.&nbsp; There are a few main components that you will need to include on
        a page that uses Kit3D in order to make it work.<br />
