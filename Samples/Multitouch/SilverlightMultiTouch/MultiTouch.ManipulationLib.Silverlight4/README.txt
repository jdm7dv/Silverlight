This package contains APIs for using manipulation and inertia in Silverlight.

Multi-touch support in Microsoft Windows 7 allows applications to blur the lines between computers and the real world.  Touch-optimized applications entice users to touch the objects on the screen, drag them across the screen, rotate and resize them, and flick them across the screen using their fingers.

Manipulations and Inertia processor classes allow graphical user interface (GUI) components to move in a natural and intuitive way. Manipulations enable users to move, rotate, and resize components by using their fingers. Inertia enables users to move components by applying forces on the components, such as flicking the component across the screen.

This Silverlight assembly contains APIs which applications and controls can use to implement multi-touch manipulations & inertia gesture functionality.  This is equivalent to the System.Windows.Input.Manipulation assembly included in the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and is provided for educational purposes only (this sample version of this assembly is not redistributable for commercial environments).  For API documentation, please refer to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.input.manipulations(VS.100).aspx
