Silverlight Store

Warning: If the SilverlightStore application is set to the default, it will load 
         in your browser using the file scheme (i.e. "file://c:\...") and cause 
         errors.  Be sure to set the 'SilverlightStore.Web' project as your 
         default startup project.  

This simple application demonstrates the use of XML data and a POCO (plain old CLR object) 
DomainService.  The server-side use of the DomainDataSource control is used to render 
content as well as a XML sitemap---all indexable by search engines.  The down-level 
content is only visible to clients viewing the site without the required version of 
Silverlight installed (or JavaScript disabled).
